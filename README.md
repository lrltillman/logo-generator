# Logo Generator 

## Description
This logo generator can be used to create a basic logo where the user can customize the text content, text color, shape, and shape color of their logo. This is done by using node.js to generate a simple svg file. 

## Usage
This app can be used by anybody to create a basic logo. A user will need access to node.js, and they will need to run "node index.js" to start the app. Then, they just need to follow the guided questions created using inquirer. 

## Tools
This project uses node.js, with several dependencies: inquirer, fs, and jest. 

## Testing
Three tests were done to complete this assignment, one for each class of logo shape. All three tests are seeing if the writeFile method correctly renders the svg code to a new svg file. All three tests passed.
